# leaflet-challenge


## Background
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) collects a vast amount of earthquake data worldwide every day. The challenge is to develop a meaningful way to visualize this data using Leaflet, providing a tool to educate the public and government organizations about Earth's processes and natural hazards.

### Before You Begin
Create a new repository named "leaflet-challenge" for this project.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Inside the local repository, create directories "Leaflet-Part-1" and "Leaflet-Part-2".
Download the necessary files from Module 15 Challenge files and place them in the respective directories.
Push your changes to GitHub.
Instructions
Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
Get Your Dataset:

### Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page.
Choose a dataset (e.g., "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days").
Obtain the JSON representation URL for the chosen dataset.
Import and Visualize the Data:

Use Leaflet to create a map that plots all earthquakes based on their latitude and longitude.
Size the data markers according to the earthquake magnitude.
Color the data markers based on the depth of the earthquake.
Include popups with additional information about each earthquake.
Create a Legend:

Build a legend to provide context for the map data.
Legend should display depth ranges with corresponding colors.
Readme:

Create a README.md file in the repository.
Include instructions on how to obtain the dataset and run the visualization.
Provide a brief overview of the project and its purpose.
